## Questions to answer

1. Develop a name for each customer group based on the information from the graph. For example, one group might be called “Frugal” while another might be called “Shopaholic.” Explain your reasoning for each label.

The Red Cluster would be Low Income, Low Spending. Their name would be "Frugal" because the group has low annual income and low spending scores, suggesting that they're careful with their money, and would pritoize saving over spending. The Orange Cluster would be Moderate Income, Moderate Spending. Their name would be "Average Spenders" as they are a group that has a balanced approach to spending. The Green Cluster would be High Income, High Spending. I would name them "Shopaholics" as they this group has high annual income and high spending scores. The Blue Cluster would be High Income, Low Spending. I would call them "Savers" as despite haqving high annual ncome, they usually don't spend a lot, and just save. They're investing for the future. The Purple Cluster would be Very High Income, and Moderate Spending. I would name their group "Prudent Wealthy" as they have high annual income but moderate spending scores, indicating that they significant wealth but are cautious in their spending. 

2. What group would a customer who has a medium income and low spending habits be in? In the Frugal group as they are careful with their finances, and prioritize savings over spending. 

3. Choose one cluster of interest to you. How might the marketing team approach this specific customer group? I would pick the "Shopaholics" group. I would probably market a product with Celebrity Endorsements so it influences their decision into buying the product because it can influence their spending habitats because someone bought it. Furthermore, I'd try to market the product as luxury and exclusive. I'd probably use high-quality packaging to make it seem premium. Maybe launching a limited supply of a certain type of the product so consumers would want to get it because it might go off-sale forever.
