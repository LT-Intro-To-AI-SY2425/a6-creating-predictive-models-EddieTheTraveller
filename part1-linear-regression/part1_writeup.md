# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this linear regression model?
The r squared value that I got was 0.62. The best thing we can say in regard to this model is that there's not a linear relationship between variables. It's not close to 1 or -1, so this model isn't really accurate as we would like it to be. There's a lot to be had, that isn't showing.

2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 42 years old?
The predicted stysolic blood pressure is around 137.46 

3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?
Honestly, I think there is an inaccuracy within this model predictions. There is a lot more variables and circumstances that we must take into consideration. I don't think this model is reliable due to the fact that there's a lot of variables missing, and the r square value is not close to 1 or -1 to even consider this accurate. We could perhaps improve the model by maybe adding other variables like existing conditions that may contribute to high blood pressure. Perhaps the time someone sleeps, how much caffeine they take, if they drink or not, etc. There's conditions that could be added that could perhaps make this variable more accurate and better.
